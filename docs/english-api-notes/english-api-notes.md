# English API Notes

While the overall API description is written in German, this section describes the main data models
and their attributes in English. The intention of the section is to allow English speaking
implementers to understand the basic ideas behind most of the API elements and attributes.
While it is, presumably, not as useful as a full translation of the API document, it provides,
at least, a starting point for implementation work.

Most of the descriptive texts are probably readable and understandable when run through an automatic
online translation service, but the specific meaning of the attributes, especially if the attribute
name is a shortening of a word, requires a more precise translation in order to be usable for
implementation. Providing a short description of these terms in the context of the API is the
primary purpose of this section.
